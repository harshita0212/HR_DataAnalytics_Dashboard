# Interactive HR Data Analytics Dashboard ðŸ“ˆ
This repository contains the details for an interactive HR dashboard built to analyze and visualize key human resources metrics. The project demonstrates a full data analysis workflow, from data cleaning and modeling to creating a user-centric, interactive report.

# Live Dashboard

HR Data Analytics Dashboard

# Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide a clear, data-driven overview of the company's workforce. The dashboard focuses on analyzing key metrics such as employee attrition, total employee count, and active employee numbers to uncover insights that can inform strategic HR decision-making.

# Technical Workflow
The project followed a structured process to ensure data integrity and create an efficient, insightful final report.

Data Cleaning & Transformation:

Raw data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis primarily using Microsoft Excel and Power Query.

Initial analysis, such as creating a pie chart for department-wise attrition, was conducted in Excel.

Data Integration & Modeling:

Cleaned data was imported into Power BI from multiple sources, including Excel files and a MySQL database.

A robust data model was created by identifying fact and dimension tables and establishing relationships to build a coherent schema. Age bands and employee counts were generated for frequency analysis.

# Data Visualization:

Power BI was used to build a dynamic and interactive dashboard, creating a compelling visual narrative from the data.

# Dashboard Features & Visual Highlights
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of HR metrics through various interactive visuals:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): A summary table highlights critical metrics like Overall Employee Count, Attrition Rate, Active Employees, and Average Age.

Attrition Analysis: Detailed tables and charts showcase department-wise and education-field-wise attrition rates, helping to pinpoint areas of concern.

Job Role Insights: Dynamic bar charts, pie charts, and maps are used to illustrate job satisfaction and rating surveys for specific job roles.

Interactive Filtering: Users can dynamically explore the data using slicers for key demographics, such as education level (e.g., Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, Doctoral Degree).

# Key Technical Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases proficiency across the entire data analysis lifecycle.

1. Data Load and ETL (Power Query)
Efficient Data Handling: Loading only essential data to the model to enhance report performance.

Data Transformation: Managing missing/null values, merging columns, and changing data types.

Feature Engineering: Adding new custom columns to enrich the dataset.

Query Management: Appending and merging multiple queries to create unified tables.

2. Data Modelling
Schema Design: Identifying fact and supporting (dimension) tables to build a logical schema diagram.

Relationship Management: Creating, editing, and deleting relationships between tables to ensure data integrity and accurate analysis.

3. Power BI Visualization & DAX
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Building new measures and calculated columns for essential, complex analysis that goes beyond basic metrics.

Dashboard Development: Creating a user-centric, interactive dashboard that allows for easy data exploration.

Advanced Analysis: Developing new tables within Power BI to support more profound and specific analytical needs.
